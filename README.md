Programming Problem 17.8: Sequence Alignment
This file describes an instance of the sequence alignment problem. The format of the file is:
1st line: length of X and length of Y
2nd line: gap cost and mismatch cost (the latter is the same for every pair of distinct symbols)
3rd line: X sequence
4th line: Y sequence
(Answer: the NW score is 224.)

148 123 (length of X and length of Y)
4 5 (gap cost and mismatch cost)
